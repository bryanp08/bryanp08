Hi there!  For a little bit of background about myself - I have 14 years of professional development experience focusing on enterprise Java, working on server based Java applications.   In recent years I have moved to a cloud-first mentality, leveraging OpenShift and Kubernetes to move to cloud technologies.  I have plenty of experience blending old and new technlogy.   I also enjoy test automation and streamlining development processes leveraging JMeter and Jenkins.  I love to write code, review code, dig into design and architecture - this kind of stuff is a fun for me.  I always find myself constructively disatisfied and wanting to polish/optimize code further.
